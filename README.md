This project aims to develop a comprehensive framework addressing key aspects of data engineering, data analysis, visualization, and machine learning model development within the Steam Community, using Microsoft Fabric (Azure Data Stack). The framework is designed to optimize the collection, processing, and analysis of data related to user behavior, gaming trends, and interactions within the Steam community. Additionally, it includes a comparative analysis of gaming data across other popular platforms such as Nintendo and PlayStation.
